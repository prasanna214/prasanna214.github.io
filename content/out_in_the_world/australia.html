  <h2>Trip to Australia</h2>

  <p>Australia was the first ever developed nation I had travelled to. I was there on a work trip. Everything there felt so beautiful. The colors were brighter, the air lighter, the land more spacious. People seemed kinder. I kept thinking to myself how good the quality of life is here and why doesn’t everyone get the chance to experience something like this.</p>

  <p>The population is much smaller than back home, and I felt very free and calm. Nature stretched endlessly in every direction. I noticed the lives I glimpsed and couldn’t help but envy them, not in a bitter way, but in recognition of what is possible. Though of course I was judging only from the outside, and reality might be different from what it seemed in my head.</p>

  <p>After meeting some amazing people and having the most interesting, present conversations, something in me moved. For the first time ever, briefly, I experienced what it feels like to be part of a community. That particular feeling that comes from being part of a tribe—people who are kind, soft, who say sorry, thank you, and I love you without holding back. I felt it in Australia.</p>

  <p>And then my mind started asking this question: am I only going to feel like I belong if I move this far away? That realization felt brutal. I didn’t mind leaving, but what if my family needed me? How fair is it to cut them off, or only show up once every few years?</p>

  <p>Sitting under a big tree in the park, I stared at a couple of ducks swimming in the pond for quite some time. It felt like I was inside a meditation video on YouTube. Through this calm, I realized I don’t have to decide anything right now. I had only just seen this place, only just experienced a few days, a handful of conversations. It made me more curious, more inspired to travel, to see the rest of the world, to feel how it might be elsewhere. Questions remain, answers aren’t needed yet and maybe that’s the point.</p>

  <p>Anyway, I felt super grateful for this experience. For the beauty of this country, for the clarity gained, for friendships I strengthened, and for the messy, wandering thoughts themselves. I have decided that simply observing, reflecting, and being present was enough at that time.</p>
